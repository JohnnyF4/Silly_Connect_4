
How to play connect 4:
- Number of players: 2
- Each player takes turns dropping pieces onto the board
- Once a player has aligned 4 pieces, either, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, that player wins

- Type "play" onto the console when you want to begin
- Use the pygame window to play by clicking on the column you wish to place your piece
  - The game automatically closes when someone wins

- Have Fun! =)
